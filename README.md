# Symmetrical Laboratory Power Supply
Modifying a computer 300W Power Supply into a stabilized symmetrical laboratory Power Supply

The Power Supply bloc provide fixed outputs at 12v, -12v and 5v as well as GND plots.
Furthermore, a DC-DC Buck step down converter is giving an other output this time variable on with tension can be settle and current limitation adjusted

  *  Red = +5V
  *  Yellow = +12V
  *  Blue = -12V
  *  Orange = +3.3V
  *  White = -5V (older power supply units only)
  *  Purple = +5V Standby
  *  Black = Ground (0V)
  *  Gray = power is on (output)
  *  Green = PS_ON# (turn DC on by shorting to ground).
